Chronline [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dukechronicle/chronline.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dukechronicle/chronline)
=========

This is the code for the [Duke Chronicle](http://www.dukechronicle.com) website. The Chronicle is Duke's independent daily news organization. The site was written entirely by undergrad students at Duke. We are one of the few college news organizations that have a dedicated team responsible for building, maintaining, and running the online product. We want to build a platform for providing information and fostering discussion within the Duke community, and we take this mission very seriously. This is a project that will continue to improve as we try to build the *best* news platform out there.

Development
=============

Documentation for development is in the [wiki](https://github.com/dukechronicle/chronline/wiki). To get the site up and running, check out the [setting up](https://github.com/dukechronicle/chronline/wiki/Setting-Up) page. We are very open to comments, suggestions, and pull requests.
