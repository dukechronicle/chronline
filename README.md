Chronline
=========

This is the code for the [Duke Chronicle](http://www.dukechronicle.com) website. The Chronicle is Duke's independent daily news organization. The site was written entirely by undergrad students at Duke. We are one of the few college news organizations that have a dedicated team responsible for building, maintaining, and running the online product. We want to build a platform for providing information and fostering discussion within the Duke community, and we take this mission very seriously. This is a project that will continue to improve as we try to build the *best* news platform out there.

Development
=============

Documentation for development is in the [wiki](https://github.com/dukechronicle/chronline/wiki). To get the site up and running, check out the [setting up](https://github.com/dukechronicle/chronline/wiki/Setting-Up) page. We are very open to comments, suggestions, and pull requests.

Join Us
-------

The Chronline team is a small group of undergrads who are passionate about programming and building something awesome. This is a great chance to get some real software engineering experience. If you are a current Duke student and are interested in helping us, you can send an email to [*recruitment@dukechronicle.com*](mailto:recruitment@dukechronicle.com). Anyone interested in web design should also definitely reach out!

Writing Tests
-------------

We are building up our test coverage slowly. We would like for all new code to have tests. Sometimes hard deadlines make this difficult, but we request that any pull requests come with tests. For more about our testing infrastructure, see the [testing](https://github.com/dukechronicle/chronline/wiki/Testing) wiki page.
