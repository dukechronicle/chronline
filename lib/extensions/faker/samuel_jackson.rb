Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?
Bitch, be cool!
Mama, I smoked the color TV!
Everybody strap in. I'm about to open some fucking windows!
Was that a goddamn shark broke through that door?
I'm serious as a heart attack.
I can do that.
Is she dead, yes or no?
Hold on to your butts!
Are you ready for the truth?
We happy?
I gotta piss.
No man, I don't eat pork.
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.
Do you see any Teletubbies in here?
Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?
Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it?
Well, that's what you see at a toy store.
And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
Your bones don't break, mine do.
Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine.
You don't get sick, I do.
But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water.
We swallow it too fast, we choke.
We get some in our lungs, we drown.
However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I.
We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.
Now that we know who you are, I know who I am.
Because of the kids.
They called me Mr Glass.
You think water moves fast?
You should see ice.
It moves like it has a mind.
Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder.
After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out.
Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out.
Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now.
We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't.
Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?
Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami.
This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime.
Do you believe that shit?
It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime.
Like they're actually proud of that shit.
My money's in that office, right?
If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there.
Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is.
She gonna tell me too.
Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker.
You understand?
Hey, sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know 'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker.
Just 'cause you pour syrup on something doesn't make it pancakes!
The very best there is.
When you absolutely, positively got to kill every motherfucker in the room, accept no substitutes.
Whoa.
Y'all take a chill.
You got to cool that shit off.
And that's the double-truth, Ruth.
Yeah, Zeus! As in, father of Apollo?
Mount Olympus?
Don't fuck with me or I'll shove a lightning bolt up your ass!
I remember my first time, it was out behind my uncle's barn with my second cousin.
She was two tons if she weighed a pound, I could have done better for myself.
Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!
But you are aware that thereâ€™s an invention called television and on this invention they show shows.
You're the weak.
And I am the tyranny of evil men.
But I'm tryin', Ringo.
I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd.
I don't want to hear about no motherfucking ifs.
All I want to hear from your ass is, you ain't got no problem, Jules.
Get the fuck out my face with that shit.
The motherfucker said that shit never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull on account of your dumb ass.

    PARAGRAPHS = k "Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you.But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass.
Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?
